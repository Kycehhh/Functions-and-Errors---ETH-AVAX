## Smart Contract Project
A Solidity smart contract demonstrating the use of require(), assert(), and revert() statements for error handling.

## Description
This Solidity smart contract, named ErrorHandling.sol, acts as a learning tool for error handling in Ethereum smart contracts. It demonstrates how to use require(), assert(), and revert() functions through functionalities like depositing and withdrawing funds, resetting the balance, and even triggering errors on purpose.

## Executing
- Head to Remix IDE: You can find it online at Remix IDE online compiler.
- Create a new file: Name it ErrorHandling.sol.
- Copy and paste the code: Grab the code from the ErrorHandling.sol file and put it in your new file within Remix.
- Compile the contract: Use the built-in Solidity compiler in Remix to check the code.
- Deploy the contract: Choose your preferred Ethereum network and deploy the contract using Remix's deployment features.
